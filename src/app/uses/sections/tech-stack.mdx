    The library for web and native user interfaces.

  <UsesItem title="Next.js">
    Next.js is a framework on top of React. It is one of the most popular
    choices when building full-stack applications with React, because it comes
    with lots of features out of the box (e.g. routing, caching), several
    rendering strategies within the same application to optimize for different
    goals and all the recent features from React (e.g. Server Components and
    Server Functions) to connect your React application to the backend.

  <UsesItem title="Tailwind CSS">
    I believe Tailwind is the best choice today for rapid product development
    and maintaining CSS in the long term. From my own experience, once you get
    the hang of Tailwind after a week, it's hard to imagine going back to
    traditional CSS approaches.

  <UsesItem title="Shadcn UI">
    UI libraries come and go, but Shadcn UI has been trending for over a year
    now. It's a popular choice that works seamlessly with Tailwind CSS and
    offers a refreshing approach to UI management with its versionless system.
    I'd say it's a great choice for now, until the next big thing comes along or
    if everything starts to look too similar again.
  </UsesItem>
  <UsesItem title="Lucide Icons">
    Since this icon library already comes with Shadcn UI, I wouldn't see a need
    to replace it with something else. Once there is another popular kid on the
    block, I would consider switching for the next project.
  </UsesItem>
  <UsesItem title="TypeScript">
    I think there is not much say about this choice. TypeScript became the
    industry standard for JavaScript projects and it is a great choice to have a
    better developer experience, less bugs and more maintainable code.
